# Learning About Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!
What I like most about version control is the collaboration aspect of being able to simultaneously make several changes individually, and then being able to bring all of it back together in the main branch.
What I find most challenging so far (I have no experience using this in real-life setting) is learning about the workflow when using Github, as it is very different from what I am accustomed to (using Google Docs).
